# Chess_game

Final project for game programming.

Created a chess engine for single player gameplay. Implemented game AI using minimax with some (bad) optimaiztion on part we thought to be key to evaluating a board, such as, number of white pieces, number of black pieces, number of pieces defending (weighted by points of each piece), number of pieces attacking (weighted by points), etc.
